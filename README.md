# CS4227_Blockbuster

A Java and Spring based microservice with frontend HTML elements.
The aim of this project was to showcase a series of design patterns while creating a business application.
We decided on creating a movie rental application that uses the Springboot Framework to create a series of endpoints. This framework is interwoven into a ThymeLeaf to create a number of accesible webpages. The data is being simply read from a CSV file upon startup.
The project also implements JUnit testing Sonar checking into the pipeline to ensure good code coverage and to catch security vulnerabilities.
